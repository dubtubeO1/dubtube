# DubTube ‚Äì Project Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Quick Description

DubTube is a web application that enables users to translate YouTube videos into their desired language while maintaining audio synchronization. Users submit a YouTube link and select a target language; the app extracts the audio, transcribes it, translates the text, generates a new voiceover, and plays the translated audio in sync with the original video. DubTube focuses on a seamless, user-friendly experience with a clean UI and efficient processing.

---

## 2. Video Processing Flow

**Step-by-Step:**
1. User submits a YouTube URL and selects a target language.
2. System checks if the video and translation already exist in cache/database.
   - If yes, fetch and serve cached data.
   - If no, proceed to process the video.
3. Extract audio from the YouTube video using yt-dlp.
4. Transcribe the audio using Whisper API.
5. Translate the transcription using DeepL API.
6. Generate a new voiceover using ElevenLabs API.
7. Store results in cache/database for future requests.
8. Present the user with a player: YouTube video (muted) + translated audio.

---

## 3. Processing Pipeline

**Technical Steps:**
1. **Audio Extraction:**  
   - Use yt-dlp to download audio in MP3 format (128kbps, max 100MB).
2. **Transcription:**  
   - Use Whisper API for speech-to-text with timestamps.
3. **Translation:**  
   - Use DeepL API to translate the transcription into the selected language.
4. **Text-to-Speech:**  
   - Use ElevenLabs API to generate a new audio file in the target language, matching the original timing as closely as possible.
5. **Caching:**  
   - Store transcriptions and translations permanently.
   - Store generated audio for 7 days (to save costs).
   - Use NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for video data, SQL (e.g., Supabase) for user/payment data.

---

## 4. User Flow

**Step-by-Step:**
1. **Homepage:**  
   - User sees a simple form: YouTube URL input, language selector, and "Translate" button.
2. **Submission:**  
   - User submits the form.
   - If not logged in, prompt for authentication if limits are exceeded.
3. **Processing:**  
   - Show a real-time progress/loading bar.
   - Backend processes the video as described above.
4. **Result:**  
   - User is shown a page with the embedded YouTube video (muted) and a custom audio player for the translated voiceover.
   - User can play, pause, and seek within the video/audio.
5. **Limits:**  
   - Unauthenticated: 1 video/day, max 5 min.
   - Authenticated: 5 videos/day, max 10 min.
   - Paid: Unlimited.

5. Features ‚Äì AI Implementation Prompts
Each feature below is defined as a module. Subtasks are structured in execution order to guide AI development tools.

‚úÖ 5.1. YouTube Video Translation Module
Goal: Take a YouTube URL and a target language, then return a translated audio stream in sync with the original video.

Steps:

Validate the YouTube URL format and video availability.

Check user authentication and enforce limits by tier.

If cached result exists for (videoId + language), fetch and return it.

If not:

Extract audio using yt-dlp (MP3, 128kbps, ‚â§100MB).

Transcribe audio using Whisper API with timestamps.

Translate transcript using DeepL API to the selected language.

Generate translated voiceover using ElevenLabs API.

Store results in cache.

Display a progress/loading UI during processing.

Return an embedded (muted) YouTube player and play translated audio via custom player.

üéß 5.2. Audio Synchronization Engine
Goal: Match the translated audio timing to the original video.

Steps:

Use Whisper timestamps to determine phrase-level timing.

Generate translated voiceover using ElevenLabs with:

Similar pause and pacing patterns.

Time-stretching or silence-padding if necessary.

Ensure audio seek is synchronized with YouTube player.

Implement fallback: if syncing fails, offer a ‚Äúdesync warning‚Äù notice.

üíæ 5.3. Caching & Storage Layer
Goal: Minimize redundant processing and API costs.

Steps:

On translation request, check if:

Transcription already exists.

Translation exists in target language.

Audio is still stored (within 7-day retention window).

Store:

Transcriptions and translations permanently in NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB or Supabase KV).

Audio files in object storage (Supabase or S3) with 7-day TTL.

Provide a manual mechanism for cache invalidation (e.g., CLI or admin panel).

Implement lastAccessed field to auto-prune unused data in future.

üôç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 5.4. User Authentication & Tier Management
Goal: Manage users, authentication, and usage limits.

Steps:

Set up Clerk for authentication:

Email and OAuth logins.

Session handling.

Design user schema in Supabase SQL:

users: id, email, auth_provider, tier.

payments: user_id, stripe_id, tier, subscription_status.

Integrate Stripe for payments and upgrades.

Enforce usage limits:

Unauthenticated: 1 video/day, max 5 min.

Authenticated: 5 videos/day, max 10 min.

Paid: Unlimited usage.

Show dynamic UI messages when limits are exceeded.

üßº 5.5. Clean & Minimal UI
Goal: Provide a smooth and intuitive user interface.

Steps:

Design a responsive UI with:

Homepage: YouTube URL input + language selector + "Translate" button.

Progress/loading page with real-time feedback.

Result page with:

Embedded YouTube video (muted).

Custom audio player for translated voiceover.

Sync feedback (e.g., play/pause sync).

Use Tailwind CSS or shadcn/ui components for design.

Display clear errors (e.g., "Invalid URL", "Limit reached", "Processing failed").

üìà 5.6. Analytics & Monitoring (Future Enhancements)
Goal: Monitor user activity and improve performance.

Steps (optional, can be deferred):

Track user behavior:

Pages visited.

Translation requests per user.

Log API errors and performance metrics.

Build a minimal admin dashboard for analytics and cache control.
